# Ruleset
## Version - Alpha.001

# Change Log
1. Implementation of ruleset

# Rules
1. An official race requires a minimum of 2 cars.

## Before you begin
A race can begin one of two ways: 
1. Either player rolls a numbered dice, the higher of the number has the first roll. This is suggested for younger children.
2. A time trial can be run, where both players take a single turn going around the track, the player that has the fastest lap, least amount of rolls, starts.
3. Determine the speed at which you wish to play the game. An ideal track of average movement of 14 per lap, a 1D10 is fast, a 1D6 is slow.
    * Potential car modifiers can adjust the speed of a game as well.
