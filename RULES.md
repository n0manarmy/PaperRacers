# Ruleset
## Version - Alpha.001

# Change Log
1. Implementation of ruleset

## Before you begin
Required Pieces:
* Something that represents a car. Match Box and Hot Wheels cars are ideal other objects that fit in the spaces will work.
* A set of dice. Some tracks require different dice.
* A track of some sort. One can be drawn on multiple pieces of 8x11 sheets of paper and taped together, or larger paper can be used. Track rules are specific depending on the age range that you wish to play with. Younger kids obviously just want to drive around and have fun, adults may want to take this more seriously. Included tracks will have rules and information included.

## Dice
Determine the speed you wish to play the game. The average movement for a single lap on the demo track is 14 per lap, 11 spaces on the inner loop and 17 spaces on the outer loop. A 1D10 is fast, a 1D6 is slow. Some tracks might be very specific about their dice and might require cars to conform.
* [FUTURE] Potential car modifiers can adjust the speed of a game as well.


# Determining starting positions
A race can begin one of two ways: 
* Either player rolls a numbered dice, the higher of the number has the first roll. This is suggested for younger children.
* A time trial can be run, where both players take a single turn going around the track, the player that has the fastest lap, least amount of rolls, starts.

# Rules
1. An official race requires a minimum of 2 cars. Some race styles may require more cars.
2. At the start of each turn, each player rolls the dice, moving the amount of spaces earned.
3. If a car occupies a space in front of another car, the player must spend an extra movement to pass the player.
    * A player cannot stop on the same space as an opposing player.
4. A player must always make forward movement unless they wish to draft a car in front of them. Drafting a car in front will earn that player an additional point of movement next turn. A player is capable of earning two draft tokens.
5. 
    * [FUTURE] Potential for pass blocking tokens that players can earn for some sort of roll?
    * [FUTURE] Some tracks might make it difficult for more than 2 cars, racing, consider some sort of modifier per square?
6. The players will race around the pre-determined amount of laps before considering the winner.
