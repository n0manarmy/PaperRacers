# Ruleset
## Version - Alpha.001

# Change Log
1. Implementation of ruleset

## Before you begin
Required Pieces:
* Something that represents a car, MatchBox and HotWheels cars are ideal because tracks should be designed for these kinds of sized vehicles
* A set of dice to be used for movement, depending on the speed of the game. See the rules for suggestions on dice.
* A track of some sort. One can be drawn on multiple pieces of 8x11 sheets of paper and taped together, or larger paper can be used. Track rules are specific, depending on the age range that you wish to play with. Younger kids obviously just want to drive around and have fun, adults may want to take this more seriously.

# Determining starting positions
A race can begin one of two ways: 
* Either player rolls a numbered dice, the higher of the number has the first roll. This is suggested for younger children.
* A time trial can be run, where both players take a single turn going around the track, the player that has the fastest lap, least amount of rolls, starts.

# Rules
1. An official race requires a minimum of 2 cars. Some race styles may have a required minimum above 2 cars.
2. Determine the speed at which you wish to play the game. An ideal track of average movement of 14 per lap, a 1D10 is fast, a 1D6 is slow.
    * Potential car modifiers can adjust the speed of a game as well.
