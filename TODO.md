# ToDo

* database structure for cars
    * consider json for individual cars and then develop a simple viewer for all the car files.
    * framework for car bonuses for rolls
* Logically seperate rule section to easily seperate based on age of players
* Logic for tracks and how car modifiers affect them and visa versa. Example being some tracks have hard requirements for what dice are used for movement, meaning cars don't receive diceModifier bonus. Maybe tracks contain a league ruleset and an arcade rule set.
